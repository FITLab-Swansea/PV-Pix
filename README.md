# PV-Pix:
PV-Pix is a slum community co-design of self-powered deformable smart messaging materials for inter-home connections. Each PV-Pix element consists of a deformable energy harvesting material that, when actuated by a person in one home, changes its physical state both there and in a connected home. PV-Pix includes two forms of prototypes one uses rigid materials (TiltTile) and the other flexible ones (FabricOn).
